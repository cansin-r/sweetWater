## Classes and Data Structures
The RandomWorldGenerator Class in Core will be the main driver for generating my Random world.

The randomness is derived through the string argument passed in by the user.


The RandomWorldGenerator Class contains the following instance variables:

* rand --> random object
* int seed

Random object gets initialized in the RandomWorldGenerator constructor which parses the string to find the integer and sets it as seed.
